In this tutorial on Image classification, we learn:

How docker images runs **`tensorflow`** and its dependencies environment container.
How to download the dataset and visualize images .
We have train a classifier, evaluate it and use it to make prediction on new images. 
Finally we visualize the weights the classifier learns to gain an intuition of how it works. So, digest on working classification of handwritten digits with **TF.learn**.
