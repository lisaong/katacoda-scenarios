In this step, you will containerize the application.

####Â Clone the application from its repository

`git clone https://github.com/chukmunnlee/acd_docker_workshop.git`{{execute}}

#### Change into the repository directory

`cd acd_docker_workshop`{{execute}}

#### Install the required dependencies

`npm install`{{execute}}

#### Run the Node application

`node main.js`{{execute}}

The application will be listening on port 3000. Launch a web browser and point it to http://docker:3000 to browse it.

#### Protip
You can usually list the command options for each tool. Try `git`{{execute}} or `node`{{execute}}.
